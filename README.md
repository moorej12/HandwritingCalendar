# HandwritingCalendar
A calendar application for pen enabled devices

I love working with my pen on my tablet, but only some apps support it well, and they are mostly for note taking. I want to make a calendar that will allow you to write with your pen as though it were a paper calendar, and work with how you want to input events, not force you to do it a certain way.

## Ideas for Features
- Standard calendar actions (event create, update, repeat, reminders, etc)
- Pen support in as many view as possible (on month view, in day view, in event view)
- Windows, samsung, ipad support (wherever there are pens)
- Integrate with google calendar, outlook calendar, apple calendar and other major calendar providers

## Techniques and Tools you can learn
- App development
- Web development
- API integration
- Database management
- Design ideas
- Testing
- Feature and requirement analysis
- Project management
- Version control systems
- Working with distributed teams
- Alternative input methods

Since it is not a urgent project, anyone could work on this, even if you only want to do one part. Just want to try out web development? You can work on the web portion. Want to do some image recognition work? We can just build that part. And if we only get a website, half an iOS app and some designs done, that is just fine. If you are going home for the holidays and still want to participate, then we can all practice working with remote developers (which happens quite often in the real world).
